# Looking at Athletic Data in Various Sports

As we move towards the mid-21st century the progress in world records in Athletics seems unstoppable, in fact at every point at which sports analysts, observers, and scientists alike have predicted an improvement to be impossible, a new unprecedented athlete has emerged^[1](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Linear%20models%20can%E2%80%99t%20keep%20up%20with%20sport%20gender%20gap&journal=Nature&volume=432&publication_year=2004&author=Reinboud%2CW). The longest standing track and field record is currently held by Jarmila Kratochvílová in the 800m at 34 years (although controversy surrounds that record), in nearly every other record there has been consistent improvement. Events like Breaking 2 perfectly exemplify why, with improved technology, methodology, and training slight marginal improvements should be possible for long times to come as those are rarely compiled into one event, and when they are large marginal improvements become possible. If we gifted Usain Bolt 10 tries over 10 days to set a 100 meter record in 2009 it is quite likely we would have seen a time slightly better than 9.58. So aside from variation in performance, and technological improvements, is there a literal limit that humans will reach in these performances? That is the question I investigate for several different sports here, track being the foremost as it is easiest to analyze, as well as the question of which records are the most impressive.

The long term plan is to include statistics on many different types of physical exertion and make data sets that have not been looked at previously. Right now I am starting with just 

- Running World Records
- Swimming World Records
- Cycling World Records

to identify which world records have improved the most and why. These sports are best to work with as they are almost entirely individual (some drafting is of course possible), and are time based giving a simple statistic to track improvement on. Some work samples from Running World Records are below:
