# Looking at Athletic Data in Various Sports

Long term plan is to include statistics on many different types of physical exertion and make data sets that have not been looked at previously. Right now I am starting with just 

- Running World Records
- Swimming World Records
- Cycling World Records

to identify which world records have improved the most and why. These sports are best to work with as they are almost entirely individual (some drafting is of course possible), and are time based giving a simple statistic to track improvement on. Some work samples from Running World Records are below:
